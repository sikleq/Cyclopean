# Architecture

```
GameTracking-Deadlock (vendor/, git clone, 1 commit = 1 game build)
        │  git show <rev>:<path>   (never checkout)
        ▼
pipeline/kv3.py        fast KV3 text parser (0.7 s for abilities.vdata; reference lib: 17 s)
pipeline/cache.py      parsed-file cache keyed by git blob sha  (.cache/kv3, not committed)
pipeline/flatten.py    entity -> {path: scalar}; schema aliases; noise exclusion
pipeline/diff.py       entity diff; identical changes in ≥6 entities -> '@shared' record with targets
pipeline/classify.py   field category (balance/mechanic/availability/meta/ui/visual/audio), entity kind
pipeline/extras.py     asset list diff (pak01_dir.txt CRCs), convars diff, steam.inf
pipeline/loc.py        english localization per build (names, labels, text diffs)
pipeline/history.py    -> data/builds/<build>_<commit8>.json.gz  (one record per tracker commit)
pipeline/enrich.py     adds labels / display values / BUFF-NERF direction using THAT build's loc
pipeline/catalog.py    -> data/entities.json  (every entity ever: kind, owner, first/last build, name)
pipeline/hero_table.py -> data/tables/heroes.json (columns evaluated on every build -> cell histories)
pipeline/unit_table.py -> data/tables/units.json  (troopers, buildings, neutrals; same idea)
pipeline/item_table.py -> data/tables/items.json  (tier, cost from generic_data, main properties)
pipeline/news.py       -> data/notes/steam.json (Steam News API); forum notes in data/notes/forum/*.txt
pipeline/patches.py    groups builds into patch windows (changelogs; notes-less big builds get their own)
pipeline/match.py      -> data/patches/<id>.json.gz  notes lines ⇄ data changes; documented/described/hidden/mismatch/fix
pipeline/jsonio.py     JSON I/O; *.json.gz is gzip (deterministic, mtime=0) — indexes stay plain JSON
        │
        ▼  (data/ is committed; the site never needs the tracker)
build_site.py          single entrypoint; builders/*.py write dist/ (not committed)
site/styles.css        all colours are :root tokens
site/scripts.js        sorting, cell history tooltip, heatmap, filters, search
icons/                 WebP/SVG from the game VPK (tools/extract_icons.py), keyed by entity id
```

## Commands

| What | Command |
|---|---|
| Full data refresh + site | `python build_site.py --data` |
| Site only (from committed data) | `python build_site.py` |
| Some pages | `python build_site.py patches tables` |
| Regenerate all build records | `python -m pipeline.history --rebuild && python -m pipeline.enrich --all` |
| Icons from the local game | `python tools/extract_icons.py` |
| Debug the matcher on one patch | `python tools/inspect_patch.py 2026-09-16 unmatched mismatch` |
| Tests | `python -m pytest` |

## Change statuses (patch pages)

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| documented | a note line has the same old → new numbers as the files |
| described | a note line talks about it without exact numbers (e.g. "All slows reduced by ~20%") |
| hidden | nothing in the notes covers it — the eye marker |
| mismatch (line) | the line names a property of the entity but the files say other numbers |
| fix (line) | a bug-fix line ("Fixed …") — usually no data change |

Matching rules live in `pipeline/match.py`; every fix to matching gets a test in
`tests/test_pipeline.py`. Rules so far:

- numbers match under display transforms: raw, magnitude, fraction↔percent, units↔metres, rate↔interval (1/x);
- compound values `100+1.5 → 120+1.75` = base + spirit scaling;
- `T1/T2/T3` in the line must agree with the tier of the field;
- a line without a subject (General section) needs both the numbers and a shared word (with synonyms:
  bounty↔gold/reward, guardian/walker↔tier/boss, respawn↔spawn);
- console variables take part in matching (respawn times, bounties live there);
- entities added in a window count as ONE change ("Added to the game files"), not one per field;
- a change repeated verbatim across many entities (`@shared`) counts once.

## Patch windows

`pipeline/patches.py`: window of a changelog = `[date − 3 h, next start)`. Builds usually land
17–26 h after the title date but sometimes before it; builds within `[start − 12 h, start + 30 h]`
are re-assigned to whichever neighbouring changelog they document better. Posts without a change
list (hero reveals, events) never open a window; a big build (≥150 gameplay fields) with no changelog
within 3 days becomes its own patch, named after an announcement within 2 days if there is one.

## Known schema drift (handled by aliases in `pipeline/flatten.py`)

| Build | Change |
|---|---|
| 5201 (2024-09) | `m_nAbilityBehaviors` → `m_AbilityBehaviorsBits` |
| 6468 (2026-04-30) | trooper flat DPS/resist fields → `m_VS*{…}` blocks (real restructure, not aliased) |
| 6711 (2026-09-29) | `m_WeaponInfo` → `m_mapWeaponInfos.primary` |
